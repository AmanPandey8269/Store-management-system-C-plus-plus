# Store-management-system-with-C++
This is a fully functioning academic project for my PBL task and can be used to manage and sell items in a store. 
But there is a problem, for name input it is only taking 1 character for each input thus if you try to write a name of 4 letters it will devide the characters in 4 input for 4 diffrent products and crash if input is more than 4.
so if anybody could help please see to it.
